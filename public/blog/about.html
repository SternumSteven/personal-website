<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a Brooklyn based artist, writer, and video editor, and I have a multitude of interests, passions, and hobbies. You can normally find me musing about old technology, animation, or niche television (with a huge slant on anime and tokusatsu).</p>
<p>I have worked with Adult Swim in the past via my work as a PA at Titmouse. I'm currently a PA on Disney's Kiff.</p>
<p>In the past I have also done freelance video editing, and I also edit my own YouTube videos as well as edit and produce my own podcast with help from my partner Jay Pastrana. In return, I help Jay with branding and assets for their Vtuber channel, PeratheAlien.</p>

<P>I'm a member of The Animation Guild's Health and Accomodations Group, which seeks to advocate for the improvement of health and safety in animation workspaces, spreading awareness and advocacy of COVID-19, and protecting worker's rights whether in office or working remotely.</P>
