having to shelve an earlier article / editorial I made due to the

<p>It seems that this sub culture on YouTube has really exploded over
the past couple of years especially in a “post-pandemic” world.
Watch time is king, so videos with huge runtimes often have a lot to
say, and people genuinely like hearing people’s perspectives on
other pieces of media or subcultures that they may not have been
aware of previously. Honestly, I completely understand this, as
someone who not only has been watching video essays, retrospectives,
and general media analysis for years… but for someone who’s made
media analysis. I’m also confident to say that it wasn’t great
analysis either, especially in my earlier years.</p>
<p>For context’s sake, I was originally a cartoon reviewer after
being inspired by many creatives that I had originally discovered in
the 2010s, who were making videos for years at that point. What drove
me to these videos was a sense of wanting to know more about
animation, and since I couldn’t go to a college for it I had to
take what I could get when learning more about how my favorite shows
were made. While there are absolutely lapses in my knowledge in
comparison to the average college graduate from a school focused on
art / animation, there was a surprising amount of knowledge I did
gain through just doing my own research from a bunch of old tumblr
blogs, articles, and videos. I do think that the “cartoon
community” (a nebulous term in of itself) isn’t immune from
criticism, but I would like to say that a lot of people are operating
in good faith, even though the type of analysis you normally see in
these spaces admittedly is lesser than what you’d see in film
reviews, or even typical anime reviews that I normally watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m going to name drop people that I’ve had in my sub box for
years, but people like Bennett the Sage, Geoff Thew of Mother’s
Basement, and Totally Not Mark are really good writers and often
display knowledge of not just anime/manga, but media in general and
will use that to enhance their critique when they are talking about
their subjects. On numerous occasions, all three of them have shown
to be good at talking about media in general, not just Japanese
media. Whether the subject is Invincible, Scott Pilgrim, SWAT Kats,
or Gravity Falls, their perspective is engaging to listen to. It’s
a bummer that I haven’t seen that from western animation critique,
which focuses on overviews, episode breakdowns, retrospectives, or
character analysis and tends to focus more on either currently airing
or ‘nostalgic’ kids animation. It would be unfair to say deeper
analysis doesn’t exist, but I do think that when anime analysis can
go deep into production pipeline details and break down specific
storyboarders and key animators by scene… western animation fans
deserve better than just “hey, remember this show from your
childhood?”</p>
<p>Of course, video essays aren’t solely meant for media analysis,
but the label has broadened so much that people are so eager to find
long form videos without realizing there is potential for
misinformation. It’s already a problem with film and game reviews,
but I do have to remind people (including myself) that reviews aren’t
primary sources for research and people should be encouraged to find
their own experiences with the media that connects with them.
Misinformation isn’t always intentional, but when you combine an
underdeveloped thesis and a lack of research about a niche subject,
it’s common for you to be on the receiving end of hate from people
who are much more knowledgeable. That doesn’t mean it’s good.</p>
<p>Speaking as a tokusatsu fan, I’ve seen many times people get
information that I see as basic wrong, and while it is frustrating I
do have to remember that I once was just as clueless. As a kid with a
narrow worldview that didn’t span outside of America, I genuinely
thought Kamen Rider Kabuto’s English dub was airing on US Cartoon
Network, I just never saw it for myself. In reality, it was
exclusively in southeast Asian territories. While I DO agree that
being more knowledgeable about tokusatsu can help one’s broader
understanding of Japanese media, (just like having a better balanced
media diet can help with media analysis in general), I don’t think
that harassment, especially at the expense of smaller creators, can
help with the issue of dissonant perspectives between people of
differing backgrounds when talking about Japanese media, especially
when American perspectives on anime can already vary greatly
depending on factors like age, gender, cultural background, the
ability to access media, etc.</p>
<p>I bring this up because the discussion of a certain video done by
a smaller YouTuber that made its way over to Bluesky from Twitter has
been.. Kind of a nightmare. While I disagree with the claims about
magical girls that were made in this video, including opinions on
sexuality, otaku, and the male gaze, the reception to the video feels
inconsistent. It ends up coming from three different places.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">People highly passionate and
	knowledgeable about Magical Girls who are tired of misinformation
	running rampant and are dealing with the issue at the source</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Seasoned people who are
	knowledgeable about anime in general and are also tired about
	misinformation</p></li>
	<li><p>People who generally want to shut down any sort of critique
	through a progressive lens and are doubly motivated to shut
	discussion down to discourage a “tourist” from bringing the
	vibes down, and the fact that there were research based errors about
	magical girls in the video is the perfect smoke screen, though some
	people don’t even try to hide the fact that they’d be happy if
	this user didn’t make another video again.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think the fact that it’s the norm for people to have highly
edited, highly researched video projects that can span multiple hours
has made breaking into this niche incredibly intimidating, which is
something I can entirely understand! I also think it’s just
generally a shame for this user to be seen as a punching bag. Some
critiques even have the tone of “well if you didn’t want to get
this treatment, you should have actually researched what you were
talking about”. 
</p>
<p><strong><em>The issue of having someone poorly represent a topic
you’re passionate about (regardless of if there is malicious intent
or not) cannot be solved by punching down on someone who was trying
for the first time. </em></strong>
</p>
<p>My last attempt at a researched video essay took me many months
and in spite of all the effort I put into it, I still don’t think
it is representative of my full potential. I know it’s probably
incorrect in some aspects, but it’s the best I can do and I’m
happy for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary source issue I discussed earlier also comes into play,
for some people it’s easier to listen to someone talk about media
than to watch it and have an opinion on it themselves, and I honestly
wonder how much of that blame can really be put on those who make
long form analysis like that, or if it’s something worth
considering with the way we treat analytical media in general. Again,
there is no judgment because I am guilty of doing the same thing. We
all need a “yap session” in the background while we do chores or
eat dinner.</p>
<p>I’ll fully admit that I’ve always wanted to find a way to come
to terms with video creation and accept it as part of me, and maybe
this article will help me with that. In spite of me wanting to make
my own art in a traditional sense, I still feel passionate about
writing and deeply respect people who are able to do analysis of
media and art that resonates with them. I was just as passionate
about writing as a child as I am now, and seeing those old cartoon
reviews made me feel “Hey, I can do that.”, and not in a way that
could prove that the YouTube meta is “easy”, but feeling genuine
inspiration to want to put my voice out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of it being taboo to some, those old cartoon reviews I
made still put me onto the path that I’m at now and to brush my
earlier attempts to the side would just be unfair, and I think the
threat of harassment plays into my own anxieties when it comes to
creating art. If it’s not great out of the gate, you’ll get
misinterpreted and harassed, and some people who experience that
never pick up a pencil again. I’m empathetic to this user because
of the fact that I’ve faced death threats over my insanely amateur
videos, whether it was trying to spread word of a show I enjoyed or
if I was forming my political identity and felt emboldened to want to
contribute SOMETHING to the dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing other people face harassment for wanting to express
themselves through their analysis has also made me frustrated, and I
think we need to have a serious reflection internally as to why it’s
apparently inevitable that people can get harassed for putting
something out there, and if they can’t grit their teeth through
harassment then they can’t “take criticism”. It doesn’t
matter that there is genuine criticism there, the issue is that the
harassment is the loudest. Do not take this as me saying that anyone
criticizing a creator for spreading misinformation, or simply
disagreeing with their perspective, is the same as a harasser, by the
way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do want to pose the question, is there a genuine motivation to
want to discuss perspectives and come to an understanding? Or do you
just want to stop someone who had a “bad opinion” from having any
sort of opinion ever again? I don’t believe it’s good for anyone
to immediately assume the worst intent from opinions from people who
are branded by “tourists”.</p>
<p>The barrier for entry for making YouTube videos has always been
low, by design. I don’t believe that everyone will know everything,
but if there is a genuine motivation to learn more through improving
at researching and refining the writing process, people should be
encouraged to continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of this incident reminding me of my own baggage regarding
publicizing art of any form online, it’s also reminding me that I’m
still trying, in spite of my slower speed, and that should count for
something. I wish luck to that creator, and I also genuinely think
that making your own analysis instead of contributing to the internet
hate machine can have a much better impact on your own mental health,
speaking from experience.</p>
