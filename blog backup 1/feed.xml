Hey there, I’m currently writing this as I juggle… a lot. I
honestly apologize for the lack of consistent updates. Life has been
pretty hectic. I do hope however, that everyone has been okay during
this holiday season.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Let’s speedrun
through things I have on my plate.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western">VIDEOS / ARTICLES</h1>
<p>I want to get a Kamikaze Girls video essay done before year’s
end. I have some people who are nice enough to check the script out
and feedback, but this is still going to try to be a personal yet
well researched project. I already have the movie (which you can buy
here) and I just purchased a digital copy of the manga that I’ll
also be reading.</p>
<p>Sadly, life is hectic so I don’t know when I’ll be able to get
that big Initial D video done. I need to get the lead out with video
making, but it will get done eventually. The aim of having articles
on this site IS to get more of them out quicker and made into
potential videos, after all.</p>
<p>I honestly have many articles I’ve wanted to finish up but I’m
too much of a perfectionist and it’s stopped me from getting all of
them done. I’m trying to write more about some nerd stuff as well
as tech habits, anime, or whatever else. Hopefully that’ll lead to
a new opportunity, but I won’t count my eggs before they hatch.</p>
<h1 class="western">PODCAST</h1>
<p>I’m trying to get a new side show format off the ground, Extra
Kash, or KashCast B-Sides maybe? Basically, people will be invited on
to talk about a specific topic rather than following the interview
format that lets people primarily talk about their jobs and
backgrounds. I recorded one with Buster Corp about the future of
Super Sentai, but with the current treatment of Maya Imamori it feels
a bit tone deaf to talk about. Nobody could have seen it coming, but
it’s affecting how we navigate talking about toku for a while. At
the very least, I’ll wait until the block’s less hot so to speak.
I do have a 12 minute clip of the episode where we talk about non
Toei tokusatsu recommendations, and will upload that as soon as I
can.</p>
<p>For the main show, I still have to edit the episode I did with
Nick Cruz, one of the color designers on Kiff, the show I work on
during the day. Nick is a great guy who’s immensely talented in his
own right and we naturally click because of having a huge amount of
interests being shared. I do have an episode with Justin Sevakis, CEO
of MediaOCD and the original creator of Anime News Network, locked in
but we haven’t recorded yet.</p>

<p>Other people I’m reaching out to (<i>disclaimer – some of
these have not been confirmed, there’s no guarantee they’ll
positively be on the show until I make an announcement on social
media</i>):</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Sean Davis – indie animation creator of “Legends of the
	Deep”</p>

	</ul>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>I also have a podcast guest appearance on Ayumi’s “Sparkleside
Chats” podcast, if you’re a fan of magical girls it’s already a
huge recommendation, but the episode I was on was actually a tribute
to 2020’s “Magical Girl Friendship Squad”!</p>
<p>MGFS was special to me due to being so obsessed with it I made a
45 minute video essay about it way before I broke into animation, and
lo and behold a good chunk of the crew is either still at Titmouse,
or some of them are my coworkers now (including Angela de Vito). It
should be easy to find online, and I do hope that other people see it
as the passion project it was.</p>
<p>Friends of the show, The Sunflower Club, are also currently
offering very affordable spots in their magazine to promote your
indie project! Send them some love, and take advantage of this in the
future in case you want more eyes on what you’re creating.

<h1 class="western">WEBSITE</h1>
<p>As I write this in LibreOffice, I’m currently trying to get used
to Neocities again. In order to move off of ghost, this means I will
have to re-write my articles in order to have them show up on my
Neocities. As of now, my ghost site is still online, but I need more
control and ONLY having my credit card be a payment option is a
no-go.</p>
<p>The new website will have easy to find links to <i><b>The
Animation Production Survival Guide</b></i><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">
and I’ll also reach out to other resources I’ve found, or other
people I know have made. I strongly believe in people being able to
share resources and knowledge. </span></span><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">You
can also look forward to guest profiles on the podcast, and maybe a
gallery of all of the album art we’ve used?</span></span></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

<h1 class="western"></h1>

<h1 class="western">ACTIVISM</h1>
<p>I haven’t been able to do as much work as I’d like, but I’m
currently a member of the TAG Health and Accommodations Group. It’s
made by a lot of wonderful people who are trying to raise awareness
and fight for change in the workplace, rallying around causes to make
sure both in-office and remote workers are safe and have
representation, while making sure everyone is informed and can
advocate for themselves as well as their peers, especially regarding
COVID.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more, feel free to click here,
and join our server if you work in animation!
<a href="https://linktr.ee/tag839haa">https://linktr.ee/tag839haa</a></p>
<p>I can’t do everything, of course. But I make an active effort to
advocate for my fellow peers as well, especially with the state of
the industry not being the best, and people having a tough time in
general this year. It’s important to help the people you care about
while staying politically informed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.project2025.observer/en">https://www.project2025.observer/en</a></p>
<p>Do your part to call PayPal as well because payment processors are
actively harming queer and NSFW creators and the ability to make art
or media that is even slightly transgressive is actively being
affected.</p>

<h1 class="western">ART / MY OWN CREATIONS</h1>
<p>I hope that 2026 is a better year to get my web comic, “Fragments”
off the ground. As I write this, the very real fact that I work on
too many projects is starting to sink in, but I’m going to try to
get a better mindset about my art and learn more about creating in
order to make something out of it. With luck I can code an
independent site about it as well? 
</p>
<p>I’m helping an art collective made by my friend Venchii, and
I’ll update this space about that as well. I’m learning the hard
way though that I WILL be fatigued if I don’t also take care of
myself, so I’m going to be more proactive in taking breaks and
making things for myself instead of ONLY making things for others.</p>
<p>There’s also no set schedule for anything I’m making
especially since due to my inconsistent schedule I haven’t made
much money off of it. I’ll update my site in case one does want to
support me, but don’t feel obligated.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Thanks for being patient with me this year, I’ve faced a lot of
struggles and continue to face them but I’m going to try to keep my
head up. Here’s to 2026!</p>
